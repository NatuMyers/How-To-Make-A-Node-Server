**_<font face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#0078B3">As most people, you have probably experienced this problem at one time or another. The Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox were conceived for this purpose, to help you copy one page at a time. But if the site consists of 1000 pages, you'd have to click your mouse 1000 times and choose a directory 1000 times when you save the file. Now another option is available: using the new version of the Offline Downloader  program. All you have to do is enter the address of the website without having to worry about downloading it. Then you just wait for a short time until the program copies all or part of the website you have requested.</font></font>_**  
[![](images/offlinedownloader.gif)](images/mainform.gif)  
<font face="arial,helvetica">The **Offline Downloader** program is conveniently designed to download Internet websites exactly the way you want them, including or excluding any parts you need or don't need (such as directory, domain and file names, types of files, their size or any other properties). The program can download up to 100 files at a time, which saves you a huge amount of time compared to ordinary browsers. All data retrieved are stored in the directory you select and contain only the files and directories matching your filter instructions. </font>

<font face="arial,helvetica">The system will be a welcome addition for journalists, scientists, researchers, equity analysts and managers as well as people who surf the Internet in search of fun, for online dating purposes involving large photo galleries, or others who would just like to browse family websites containing digital photo albums. </font>

<font face="arial,helvetica">This new integrated software program contains a built-in browser which allows you to scan all websites both online and offline (on your own hard drive). The program can change html-links to relative names, allowing you to move the information easily to CD-ROM or another hard drive.</font>

<font face="arial,helvetica">Major options include superb filtering ability, which enables you to pick documents by type and names, pre-set downloading depth for websites, etc. This means you can choose to download only the first few pages of any given site, while weeding out or skipping over the stuff you don't need.   It offers numerous settings and options to facilitate this task. You can also limit your search by domain types (such as com, net, uk, etc.) by using sophisticated filtering options based on a list of key words and other auxiliary options. </font>

<font face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#000099">5-Star rating on CNET Download.com</font></font>  
![](cnet_rating-51.gif)<font face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#000066">"Quick" and "logical" perfectly describe this tool for downloading and browsing sites offline. Offline Downloader's somewhat old-fashioned yet ergonomic interface helps you along every step of the way. Rearrange the panes to suit your activities with just one click. Up to 100 simultaneous connections ensure a high speed. The software is project-based, so that you can retrieve several sites within one project and download only updated files later. The extensive options, which you set for every project, let you make optimal use of your Internet connection by filtering pages and files by type, size, and keyword. Those who are searching for an ultimate offline browser may have found it. </font></font>
